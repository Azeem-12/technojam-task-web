APPROACH TO TASK

Greetings,
I am Azeem. I have almost neglegible knowledge about this domain. I am just eager to learn new languages. I visited many youtube pages to get refrences, i learned from them about this domain and made this page. I learned many things about HTML and CSS and now i think that i would be able to work more on this domain. This is an interesting domain. I studied the source code and worked on it, took refrences and and tried few new things on my own.

CHALLENGES FACED
At first, i was not able to understand CSS, and faced difficulty. Internet issues at my hostel were a good partner to the other problems. But on learing and reading more, i figured more and now i would learn more.
